During college, I was part of a club called [ACM
Hack](https://hack.uclaacm.com/). The club runs beginner friendly workshops
focused on web development, mobile development, or anything we find useful and
fun. We also did some intermediate/advanced workshops. Another big components
we did was (mini) Hackathon, socials and expo type events. 

I enjoy teaching so I taught a lot
